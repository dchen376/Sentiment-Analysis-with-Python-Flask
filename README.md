# Sentiment-Analysis-
This is a personal project for building a **Python web app with Flask**.

The project integrated Embeddable Watson AI libraries to make the web app showcase AI-based abilities.



Additional information regarding Embeddable Watson Ai libraries:
Embeddable Watson AI libraries include the NLP library, the text-to-speech library and the speech-to-text library. These libraries can be embedded and distributed as part of your application. 

The NLP library includes functions for sentiment analysis, emotion detection, text classification, language detection, etc. among others. The speech-to-text library contains functions that perform the transcription service and generates written text from spoken audio. The text-to-speech library generates natural sounding audio from written text. All available functions, in each of these libraries, calls pretrained AI models that are all available on the Cloud IDE servers, available to all users for free.
