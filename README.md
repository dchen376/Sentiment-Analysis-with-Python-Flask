# Sentiment-Analysis-
This is a personal project by developing a **Python web app using Flask** and integrate Embeddable Watson AI libraries to make the web app showcase AI-based abilities.




Embeddable Watson AI libraries include the NLP library, the text-to-speech library and the speech-to-text library. These libraries can be embedded and distributed as part of your application. For your convenience, these libraries have been pre-installed on Skills Network Labs Cloud IDE for use in this project.

The NLP library includes functions for sentiment analysis, emotion detection, text classification, language detection, etc. among others. The speech-to-text library contains functions that perform the transcription service and generates written text from spoken audio. The text-to-speech library generates natural sounding audio from written text. All available functions, in each of these libraries, calls pretrained AI models that are all available on the Cloud IDE servers, available to all users for free.

These libraries may also be accessed through your personal systems. The guidelines for the same are available on the Watson AI library page.
